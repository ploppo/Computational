# Computational linear algebra for large scale problems
For the course in Computational linear algebra for large scale problems we produced three different homeworks:

1. Homework 1 where we performed spectral clustering using algorithms presented during the course (Matlab).
2. Homework 2 Using the Young-People-Survey (YPS) dataset we used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and, then, we identified meaningful clusters of people using the k-Means algorithm (Python).
3. Homework 3 we decided to implement a state of the art optimization of the PageRank algorithm (Matlab).

This repository contains alongside with the code produced for the three homeworks in the release associated to this repo there is the paper we produced.
